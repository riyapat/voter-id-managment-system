# voter-id-managment-system
This project “Villagers voter Id Management System”  provides us a simple interface for maintainance of voter information.It  can be used by BLO to maintain the records of voters easily. Achieving  this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is  scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant information may be  very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project.  Throughout the project the focus has been on presenting information in  an easy and intelligible manner. The project is very useful for those  who want to know about voter Information Management Systems and  want to develop softwares/websites based on the same concept.
